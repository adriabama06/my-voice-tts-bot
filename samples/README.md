# Voice Samples

This directory contains voice samples used for voice cloning.

## How to add your voice sample

1. Record yourself speaking clearly for about 30 seconds
2. Save the file as `[YOUR_DISCORD_USER_ID].wav` (e.g., `123456789012345678.wav`)
3. The bot will automatically transcribe your sample and use it for voice cloning

Alternatively, you can use the `/load` command in Discord to upload your voice sample directly.

## Supported formats

The bot automatically converts uploaded audio files to WAV format, but for best results, provide a high-quality WAV file with the following specifications:
- Mono channel
- 44.1 kHz sample rate
- 16-bit depth

## File naming convention

Files should be named with your Discord user ID:
- Example: `123456789012345678.wav` (your voice sample)
- Example: `123456789012345678.wav.txt` (auto-generated transcription)
